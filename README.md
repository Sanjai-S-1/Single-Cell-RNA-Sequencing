# Single-cell RNA Sequencing Analysis for Heart Failure Hearts with a History of Hypertension

## Overview

This bioinformatics project focuses on the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from heart tissues, specifically comparing individuals with heart failure and a history of hypertension to control subjects. The study aims to unravel the cellular landscape, identify cell markers, and perform differential expression gene (DEG) analysis to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying heart failure in individuals with a history of hypertension.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Source:** The scRNA-seq data used in this project was obtained from heart tissues of individuals with heart failure and a history of hypertension, as well as control subjects. The Data was obtained from GEO database (Accession ID -GSE222144 )

- **Objective:** The primary objectives of the analysis include:
  - Characterizing the cellular landscape of heart tissues in both control and heart failure groups.
  - Identifying cell markers associated with specific cell types.
  - Conducting DEG analysis to pinpoint genes differentially expressed between heart failure and control groups.
